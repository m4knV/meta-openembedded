Subject: [PATCH] build: don't look for Iconv

Drop the find_package() for Iconv. CMake is unable to find iconv.h in
native build but all modern systems supply it as part of the standard
C library. We don't need this check in meta-openembedded.

Signed-off-by: Bartosz Golaszewski <brgl@bgdev.pl>

Upstream-status: Inappropriate
- upstream doxygen must build on many architectures, this change is
  too intrusive for upstream
